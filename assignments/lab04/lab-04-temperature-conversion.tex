\section*{Objectives}
\label{sec-2}

\begin{itemize}
\item Write functions in C that take 1 or more parameters and return a result.
\item Learn about breaking up a larger problem into smaller sub-parts.
\item Create simple functions that use an input parameter.
\item Learn how to return results using the return values from a function.
\item Practice with input and output.
\end{itemize}
\section*{Description}
\label{sec-3}

In this lab we will write two simple functions.  The functions will
take a single parameter as input, and return a single value as their
result.  You are to write functions that convert temperatures
on the Fahrenheit scale into the Celsius scale, and vice verse.

The formula for converting a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius is
given by:

$$
C = (F - 32) \cdot \frac{5}{9}
$$

And to convert in the other direction, from Celsius to Fahrenheit:

$$
F = C \cdot \frac{9}{5} + 32
$$



\begin{verbatim}
This program finds all of the perfect numbers in the range from 1 to N.
Up to what value of N should I search for perfect numbers: 100
6 is a perfect number
28 is a perfect number
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{NOTE}: Now that our programs have more functions than just the \verb~main()~
function the use of the function headers becomes meaningful.  Make sure
that all of your functions (\verb~main~, \verb~findPerfectNumbers~, \verb~isPerfectNumber~)
have function headers before them that document the purpose of the
functions, and the input values and return value of the function. 
\section*{Lab Submission}
\label{sec-4}


An eCollege dropbox has been created for this lab.  You should
upload your version of the lab by the end of lab time to the eCollege
dropbox named \verb~Lab 04 Perfect Numbers~.  Work submitted by the end
of lab will be considered, but after the lab ends you may no longer
submit work, so make sure you submit your best effort by the lab end
time in order to receive credit.
\section*{Requirements and Grading Rubrics}
\label{sec-5}
\subsection*{Program Execution, Output and Functional Requirements}
\label{sec-5-1}


\begin{enumerate}
\item Your program must compile, run and produce some sort of output to be
  graded. 0 if not satisfied.
\item 40+ pts.  Your program must have the 2 required named functions, that 
   accept the required input parameters and return the required values
   (if any).
\item 30+ pts. Your algorithm for determining if a number is perfect in the
   \verb~isPerfectNumber()~ function must work correctly.
\item 30+ pts. Likewise the \verb~findPerfectNumbers()~ function must work, and produce
   the output as shown for the assignment.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection*{Program Style}
\label{sec-5-2}


Your programs must conform to the style and formatting guidelines given for this course.
The following is a list of the guidelines that are required for the lab to be submitted
this week.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The file header for the file with your name and program information
  and the function header for your main function must be present, and
  filled out correctly.
\item A function header must be present for all functions you define.
  You must document the purpose, input parameters and return values
  of all functions.
\item You must indent your code correctly and have no embedded tabs in
  your source code. (Don't forget about the Visual Studio Format
  Selection command).
\item You must not have any statements that are hacks in order to keep
  your terminal from closing when your program exits.
\item You must have a single space before and after each binary operator.
\item You must have a single blank line after the end of your declaration
  of variables at the top of a function, before the first code
  statement.
\item You must have a single blank space after , and \verb~;~ operators used as a
  separator in lists of variables, parameters or other control
  structures.
\item You must have opening \verb~{~ and closing \verb~}~ for control statement blocks
  on their own line, indented correctly for the level of the control
  statement block.
\end{enumerate}

Failure to conform to any of these formatting and programming practice
guidelines for this lab will result in at least 1/3 of the points (33)
for the assignment being removed.  Failure to follow other
class/textbook programming guidelines may result in a loss of points,
especially for those programming practices given in our Deitel
textbook that have been in our required reading so far.
