 * @description Implement a selection sort.  A selection sort works
 *   by finding the minimum value in an unsorted subportion of an
 *   array and then swapping this value to the correct location in
 *   the sorted portion of the array.  This implementation creates two
 *   helper functions to perform a lot of the work of the selection
 *   sort.  One function performs the search for the minimum value
 *   in portions of an array.  The other helper function swaps two
 *   locations in an array.
