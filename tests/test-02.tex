\section*{Description}
\label{sec-2}

You have 2 hours (our regularly scheduled lab time) to complete the
following tasks.  Create a single file, named test02.cpp, in a visual
studio project called Test02.  Set up the Visual Studio projects using
the normal settings for our class and labs, as we have practiced for
the past 15 weeks.  The file you submit to eCollege should be the
resulting test02.cpp.  It should contain only a single \verb~main()~
function, and any other functions and code you are asked to write for
the following tasks.

Perform the following tasks:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Here is an implementation of the \verb~bubbleSort()~ function we
   used in class to sort an array of integers in ascending
   order:

\begin{verbatim}
/** Bubble Sort
 * Sort an array of integers using a Bubble sort.
 * Bubblesort works in this manner.  On the first pass we start at
 * index 0 and compare successive items.  We swap the items if they
 * are out of order.  The result is that on the first pass, the
 * largest item will be "bubbled up" to the largest index.  On the
 * next pass, we do the same thing, but since the last item is already
 * bubbled into place, we only pass through the N-1 items.  We do this
 * for N passes.  Bubble sort is very inefficient, it is an O(N^2)
 * algorithm.
 *
 * @param values An array of integers.  The array to be sorted.  The
 *   array is passed by reference and is sorted in place in memory.
 *   The array is sorted in ascending order.
 * @param size int The size of the array to sort.
 *
 * @returns void Nothing is returned explicitly but as a
 *   result of calling this function the array
 *   that is passed in will be sorted into ascending order.
 */
void bubbleSort(int values[], int size)
{
  // outer loop, perform N passes
  for (int pass = 0; pass < size; pass++)
  {
    // inner loop, bubble up items from index 0 up to size-pass-1 index
    for (int idx = 0; idx < (size - pass - 1); idx++)
    {
      // if the values are out of order, swap them
      if (values[idx] > values[idx + 1])
      {
        int tmp = values[idx];
        values[idx] = values[idx + 1];
        values[idx + 1] = tmp;
      }
    }
  }
}
\end{verbatim}
   Modify this function to accept an array of floating point values
   instead.  Then modify the function to sort the values in descending
   rather than ascending order (e.g. The largest float should end up
   at index 0, the next largest at index 1, etc. and the smallest at
   the last index in the array).  In your \verb~main()~ function, create an
   array of 5 floats, and initialize the array with the following
   values: \verb~{-3.8, 4.2, 9.7, -2.5, 5.6}~.  Demonstrate calling your
   modified \verb~bubbleSort()~ function with this array of floats, and use
   a loop in your \verb~main()~ function to display the values in the array
   after the array has been sorted.  See the example output below for
   how you should format your resulting output for this task 1.
\end{enumerate}


\begin{enumerate}
\item After the previous task in your main function, write code to
   perform the following task.  I have given you a file named
   ``test-01-data.txt''.  This file has a single integer value on each
   line.  Open this file, and inside of a sentinel controlled loop,
   read in the values from the file and display the values to standard
   output.  Your sentinel controlled loops should simply be a while
   loop that executes until the read from the file fails.  The output
   from reading the file will be exactly as given in the example
   output shown below.
\item Write a function named \verb~calculateHypotenuse~.  The function will
   take two floating point values as parameters, named \verb~a~ and \verb~b~.
   The function should calculate the hypotenuse of a right triangle
   using the \verb~a~ and \verb~b~ parameters, according to this formula: $$ c =
   \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $$ e.g. the hypotenuse is the square root of
   adding together the square of a and b.  This value should be
   calculated and returned (as a floating point result) as a result of
   calling your function.  In your main function, show an example of
   calling your function with values of $3.0$ and $4.0$ for the \verb~a~
   and \verb~b~ parameters.
\item Create an array of integers of size $10$ named \verb~values~.  Create a
   function named \verb~initNegative~ that takes an array of integers and a
   size as its two input parameters.  This will be a void function (it
   will return no result).  This functions should initialize each
   value to be equal to the negative of the index, e.g. the value at
   index $0$ will be $0$, the value at index $1$ will be $-1$, the
   value at index $2$ will be $-2$, etc.  Call your function in
   \verb~main()~ to initialize the array.  In \verb~main~, after initializing
   the array, write a loop that displays the contents of the array.
   An example of the output from this task is shown below as the last
   part of the example output.
\end{enumerate}

Your program output for the 4 previous tasks should look something
close to the following when I run your program:


\begin{verbatim}
----- Task 1 -----

1
I generated a 1!
2
2

\end{verbatim}
\section*{Test Submission}
\label{sec-3}


An eCollege dropbox has been created for this test.  You should upload
your version of the test by the end of test time to the eCollege
dropbox named \verb~Test 01~.  Work submitted by the end of the allotted
time will be considered, but after the test ends you may no longer
submit work, so make sure you submit your best effort by the test end
time in order to receive credit.
\section*{Requirements and Grading Rubrics}
\label{sec-4}
\subsection*{Program Execution, Output and Functional Requirements}
\label{sec-4-1}


\begin{enumerate}
\item Your program must compile, run and produce some sort of output to
   be graded. You will loose at least 1/3 of the total points (33) if
   your program does not compile and run when submitted.
\item 10 pts (1 letter grade).  Up to 1 letter grade will be awarded for
   formatting and style issues for the test.  Your program must meet
   (most) all of the standard class style/formatting guidelines that
   we have been practicing and using in our labs and assignments for
   this course.
\item 20 pts. Task 1.  You must use an index controlled for loop, and
   have an if statement.  Your output for this task must be as
   shown in the example output.
\item 20 pts.  Task 2.  You must successfully open up and read from the
   given file.  You should use defensive programming to detect when
   the file is not opened or found correctly.  You must use a sentinel
   controlled loop to read all values from the file.  Your output
   for task 2 must look like that shown in the example output.
\item 25 pts. Task 3.  You must correctly name and define the function as
   required for the task.  The function must accept the correct
   parameters as input, and return the correct result type.  The
   function must be implemented correctly to perform the desired
   calculation.
\item 25 pts.  Task 4. You must correctly name and define the function as
   required for this task.  The function should take the array and the
   array size as parameters and initialize the array as specified.
   You must define the array in your main loop and invoke the function
   with your array to be initialized.  You should use a defined
   constant to specify the size of the array in main.  Your should
   display your array after being initialized, as shown in the example
   output.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection*{Program Style}
\label{sec-4-2}


Your programs must conform to the style and formatting guidelines given for this course.
The following is a list of the guidelines that are required for the lab to be submitted
this week.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The file header for the file with your name and program information
  and the function header for your main function must be present, and
  filled out correctly.
\item A function header must be present for all functions you define.
   You must document the purpose, input parameters and return values
   of all functions.  Your function headers must be formatted exactly
   as shown in the style guidelines for the class.
\item You must indent your code correctly and have no embedded tabs in
  your source code. (Don't forget about the Visual Studio Format
  Selection command).
\item You must not have any statements that are hacks in order to keep
   your terminal from closing when your program exits (e.g. no calls
   to system() ).
\item You must have a single space before and after each binary operator.
\item You must have a single blank line after the end of your declaration
  of variables at the top of a function, before the first code
  statement.
\item You must have a single blank space after , and \verb~;~ operators used as a
  separator in lists of variables, parameters or other control
  structures.
\item You must have opening \verb~{~ and closing \verb~}~ for control statement blocks
  on their own line, indented correctly for the level of the control
  statement block.
\item All control statement blocks (if, for, while, etc.) must have \verb~{~
   \verb~}~ enclosing them, even when they are not strictly necessary
   (when there is only 1 statement in the block).
\begin{enumerate}
\item You should attempt to use meaningful variable and function names in
   your program, for program clarity.  Of course, when required, you
   must name functions, parameters and variables as specified in the
   assignments.  Variable and function names must conform to correct
   \verb~camelCaseNameingConvention~ .
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Failure to conform to any of these formatting and programming practice
guidelines for this test will result in loosing 1 letter grade You can
get a B for this test if you do it perfectly, but have bad or missing
style/formatting.  To get an A, however, you need to follow (most) of
the style/formatting requirements for this course on your test code.
