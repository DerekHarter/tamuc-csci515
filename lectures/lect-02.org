* Part 1 (11 - 11:40)
** Memory Concepts, Variables, Representation

- When you declare a variable, it is assigned a location in memory.
  All references to store or access the named variable are translated
  by the C compiler using a lookup table.
- The datatype is how pattern of bits in memory are stored and
  interpreted to mean a number, a character, etc.
- Int32 representation (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_%28computer_science%29)
- Debug $\rightarrow$ QuickWatch
- Debug $\rightarrow$ Windows $\rightarrow$ Memory
- Representation of integer 1 vs. -1

** Arithmetic and Precedence
- Rules of precedence
- Integer division vs. real division
- Modulus operator

** Relational Comparisons, and the bool type
- Making decisions, we need be able to perform alternative actions
  based on making some sort of decision.
- bool should be used instead of an int for boolean flags in a program in modern c.

* Part 2 (11:45 - 12:30)
** Algorithm
An algorithm is a series of unambiguous explicit steps that can be taken to solve a problem.
An algorithm is a procedure for solving a problem in terms of:

1. the actions to execute and
2. the order in which the actions execute


** Control Structures
Normally statements in a program execute one after the other in the
order in which they are written.  This is sequential execution.

- The sequence structure is built into the C language normal operation.
  Question: what/where is the first instruction executed in a C program?
- Selection statements: single if, double if / else, multiple switch
- Repetition statements: for, while (0 or more) and do..while (1 or more)
