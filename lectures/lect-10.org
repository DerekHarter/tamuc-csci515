* First Session (11 - 11:40)
** Structure Definitions

- ~struct~ are *aggregrate* data types - they can be built using
  elements of primitive types.
- ~struct~ are basically a *record*, a row of a database or table.
- ~struct~ are an example of a *user defined type*.  Like ~enum~ they
  allow.
- In this course we don't cover object oriented analysis and design,
  but basically classes in C++ are ~struct~ user defined types with
  associated methods that operate on the new type.

* Second Session (11:45 - 12:30)
