* Chapter 1

- 1.1 Write your C++ programs in a simple and straightforward
  manner. This is sometimes referred to as KISS (“keep it simple
  stupid”). Do not “stretch” the language by trying bizarre usages.
- 2.1 Every program should begin with a comment that describes the purpose of the program.
- 2.2 Use blank lines, space characters and tabs to enhance program readability.
- 2.3 Indent the entire body of each function one level within the
  braces that delimit the body of the function. This makes a program’s
  functional structure stand out and makes the program easier to read.
